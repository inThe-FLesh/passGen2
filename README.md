# Pass Gen 2
*This project is a follow-up to a project that was never published, hence the "2" in the title.*

This project is a simple terminal app that will generate a secure password from a given input.

## Installation
Linux and Windows binaries can be found in the release page of the project. To install just download and run the program.

## Usage
The program will ask you to enter a password and will print the secure password it has generated. 
Simply copy that password into your password manager, write it down, or paste it directly into a login page.

The password generated for any given text will never change. Therefore if you lose your password you can always generate it again, 
given you remember the original password.

## Rationale
The purpose of this program is to make it easier to use unsecure passwords to generate much more secure passwords on a local machine.

I personally don't like using secure passwords generated by browsers or password managers, and I would much rather have a fool-proof method for retrieving my passwords.

Using this you no longer have to rely on browser sync or a password manager when logging in on different machines. You simply run the program and type the password you used for that service.

### Methods Used
The program uses a modified version of the BCrypt algorithm that I created during my university project.

It generates a salt using the inputted password, meaning that each password is hashed using a pseudo random salt.

The BCrypt algorithm is known for resistance to password attacks, making it a suitable choice for this kind of implementation.

## Disclaimer
This code was mostly written under time constraints of completing a project. The code has not been properly tested.

The creators of passGen2 in no way accept any liability for damages caused. 

The security of the implementation has not been validated entirely.
